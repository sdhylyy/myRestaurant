# CS5500 Course Project

## Description

This project aims to build a restaurant order website that allows users to order food from a restaurant online. Users can browse the menu, select items, customize them, and add them to the cart. They can also view their order summary and make payment using various payment methods. Restaurant order websites can be used by customers to order food for delivery or pickup, and by restaurants to manage orders, track inventory, and process payments.

To use the restaurant order website, users need to create an account and log in. They can then browse the menu by category, search for specific items, and add them to the cart. Users can customize the items by selecting options, such as toppings, size, and quantity. They can also view their order summary and make changes before checkout.

To use the restaurant order website, customers can access it through their web browsers on desktop or mobile devices. Restaurants can access it through a dashboard, where they can manage orders, update the menu, and track inventory. Overall, the restaurant order website is a convenient and efficient way for customers to order food online and for restaurants to manage orders and payments.
